# add a perfect model where the guess and random number are both random, meaning the AI needs to guess corectly on it's first try.
# add a hacks model that always guesses the number correctly.
# add a way to plot the stats of each AI model onto a graph.
# add a way to import and export user/ai stats with a txt file (or something similar).
# add intelligent hints that give the user clues about what type of number they are guessing (like is it odd, even, etc).
# add a game score and level system.
# add achievements.
# add cheats ex) tells you what the correct number is before guessing.
# add easter eggs
# add function to sum stats after each game.
# add a clear stats function (per model) that is password protected.
# clear the screen after each game as keep menus more readable.
